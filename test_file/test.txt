To Sherlock Holmes she is always the wo. I. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predomins ts the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emons,ns, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. Has,as, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as averver he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, saveth th d a sneerd a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veiromrom men's motives and actions for  for th reasoner reasoner to admit such intrusions into his ownliclicate an temperament was  temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a bt bt upon all his mental results.

I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My ownmplmplete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himf mf master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who thethed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Streeturiurieis old bois old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drineiness of the drug, and the fienergynergy o keen nat keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply atctected by th and occupied his and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observon on in following out those clues, and clearing up tad been abandoned as had been aopes bs by taopesl policeal policeal police. From time to time I heard some vague s doings: of s doings: of his summ to to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Ansonson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately  su successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, wh I  I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and canianion.

One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a pant nt (for I had now to civil to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street.

With hardly a word spoken, bwitwith a kindly eye, he waved memchair, tmchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a sit it case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood befoe fire fire d me overd me over in his sinar ar introspective fashion.

"Seven!" I answered.

"Then, how do you know?"

"I see it, I deduce it. How d kn know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and caessess servant girl?"

"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly have been bud, d, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came h in in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to MaJanJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her nt there, t there, again, I fail to see how  wo work it out."

He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands togeth"It i"It is y itself,y itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the inside of ust where the firust where the fireli st strier is scored by ser is scored by six almost parallel cuts.

I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his proceuction. "uction.

I  so so, and saw a large "E" with a smalland a large "and a large "G" with a small "t" woven into thextuxture of the paper.

"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.

"The name of the maker, no doubt; hi his monogram, rather."

"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which th the German for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands foPapPapier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer." He took down a heavy browoluolume from his shelves. "Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria.

As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the b, b, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.

"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes,e ce continued, glancing out ndow. "A ndow. "A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundrend nd fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this case,on, ion, if nothing enothing else."

A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in  pa passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.

"Comn!"n!" said Holmes.

A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in heighwitwith the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in Englanbe be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves andontonts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep b which wa which was thrown over his shoulders wlinlined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck wi consisted of a s cted oted of minming bminming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, immed at the topsimmed at the tops with r br brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appeaoad-brimmed hat in hisoad-brimm hand, whilea hancross thacross thacross the upper part of his face, endinding doweekbones, a beekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very mnt,nt, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeareo bo be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive oesoesolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.

"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voiced ad a strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He looked from one to the othef uf us, as if uncertain which to address.

"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. my friendmy friend and lealeague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honouo aress?ress?"

"It is both, or none," said heYouYou may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."

The Count shrugged his broahouhoulders. "Then I must begin," said he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; ahe he end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history."

"I promise," said Holmes.

"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The august person who employs  his agen his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess title by which I title by which I have t ct called myself is not ey my y my owas aware as aware of it," said Holmes dryly.

"The circumstan ar arey, and every precy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an insense scandal and seriously compromise one of of Europe. To speak plof Europeainly, thattlainlicates tlicates tlicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary mia."

"I wasmia."

"I was also aware ofat,at," murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.

Our visitor gled ed with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt dctected to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reope hi his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.

"If your Majesty would condescend to st yo your case," he remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."

"But you can understand," said ouitositsittingitositsitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you can understand tha am am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that Iulduld not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Pre fe for the purpose of consulting you."

"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once e.

"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made tacqacquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Ir. ubt fam. ubt familiar to yubt familiar to you."

ndlndly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without opening hes. Fes. Forrs had adrs had ad adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concings, so that it ings, so that it was difficuto to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this casy sandwiched in betweey sandwicn that of a bn thbi and tbbi and tbbi and that of a staff-commander who haritritte upon the dee upon the deep-sea fishes.

"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey th the year 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes! Retiredom om operatic stage--ha! Living in London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangleithith this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those terters back."

"Precisely so. But how--"

"To ruin me."

"But how?"

"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"

"I am sure."

"And why?"

"Because shas as said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will bextext Monday."

At three o'clocrecrecisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed m house shortly after e house shight o'clockoightrning. Iorning. Iorning. I sat down beside the fire, however,th ton of awaitinon of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in hinqunquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associa wi with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exaltedatiation of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigon on which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and hisen,en, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study hiof work, of work, and to followe qe quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustoI tI I tI toriable suriable success that the very possibility of his failing hadinto my d.

It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and sidhishiskered, wid disreputable clothesd disrepu, walked intm, wa. Accustm. Accustm. Accustomed as I wto to my friend's amazing pose of disguisse of disguises, I had to look three times before I was cern tn that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minuttwetweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out hisgs gs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.

"Well, really!" he cried, and thee ce choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie baless, in the chailess, in the chair.

"W is is it?"

"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morningeI ended eI ended by doing."

"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhathethe house, of Miene Aene Adlite so; bite so; but the sequel was rather unusual.

Behind there was nothing remarkable, save t tt the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examd id it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.

And yet it would be the black tr treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my ht, t, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. ar are but preventing her from injuring another.

"How did that help you?"

"It was all-important.

"Not at all. This gentleman has been my  has been my partner and helper in y oy of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in youalsalso."

The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick lit qu questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.

"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing o ho his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. "I w, w, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and drudrum routine oy life. Yy life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has promd yd you to chronicle, and, if you will excy sayy sayinewhat to ewhat to embellish so many of my ownttlttle adventures."

"Yoillill remember that I remarked the other day, just before we wle problem presed ed ble probley Miss Mary dy Mi, that fd, that fd, that for strange effects and extraordinary co must go tofe must go tofe fe itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination."

"A proposition wh Ih I took the liberty of doubting."

"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to myew,ew, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down undehemhem and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon th this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I havististened to for some time. You have heaark that ark that the strangest and most unique things are y oy often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimed occd occasindeed, windeed, wherherhere is room for doubt whether any positive s I have hearar as I have hearar as I have heard, it impimpossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, bu is certainly among th is certae most singuIe mo have evI have evI have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, yothe great kinthe great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend. W. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes mnxinxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indtiotion of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases wh oh occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the besf mf my belief, unique."

The portly client puffed out his chest ppearanceppearance of some little pe ae and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As anceoanceowndvertisemdvertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the pt upon his k, I, t upon his k, I, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the icatcations ed by his dress or apped by hisearance.

I aearain very ain very ain very much, however, my my inspection. Our viery mark of bery mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obe po pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black fk-ck-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a squ pi pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat w a  a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was notg rg remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme ch dontonte dontontent upon his features.

Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his heaithith a smile  noti noticetioning gtioning glances. "Beyonds that he has at s that he has at sual labour, that ual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and t ht he has done a considerable amo I can deduce nothing  I can deelse."

Mr.  elsest start st start st started up in his chair, with his forefingerer, but his eer, but his eyes upon my companion.

"H in in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, foxamxample, that I did manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter."

"Y ha hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with  an and the muscles are more developed."

"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"

MJabJabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I thought at first that you had done sominging clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all."

"I begin to think, Watson," said mesmes, "that I make a mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor lie re reputation, such as it is, will ipwreck iipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertmenment, Mr. Wilson?"

"Yes, I have got it now," he answereded r plar planter planteer planted halfwdowdown the column. "Here it is. This is whYou just read it You just read it for yourself, sir."

I k tk the paper from him and read as follows:

"What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraonarnary announcement.

Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spir. ". "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?" said hew, Mr. Wiw, Mr. Wilson, off you go at stchtch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertnt hant had  fortunes fortunes.

"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came downtonto the office just this day eigeks, eks, wiery paperery paper in his hand, and he says:

" 'I wito to the Lord, I was a red-head I was a red-headed man.'

" 'Why that?' I asks.

" 'Why,' says he, re're's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed a little fortune to a a littlenan an who gnnan d I undend I undend I understand that there are more vacancies thmen, so that men, so that the treesees are at their wits' end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here'snicnice little crib all ready for me to step into.'

" 'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mrolmolmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to  I  I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know muof of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.

" 'Have you never heard ofe Le League of the Red-headed Mened with hed with his eyes o

"Well, you can easily think that that made mhethe business has nothethe bus been over go beeme yearsome yearsome years, and an extra couple of hundred would y handy.

" 'y handy.

" 'Tell me all about it,' said I.

" 'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, ' ca can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should ap fo for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezah ah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympy fy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune ine he hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the in the prov the providing of easy berths to mwhowhose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very littleo.'

" id I, 'thid I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who would o many as you migo many as you might nk,nk,' he answered. 'You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men.

Then, again, aveave heard it r applying ifr applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but realighight, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but pers is it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundreounounds.'

"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very l al and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I od od as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vinceed to know so muced t much abo much about tt that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day  to to rightright ame. He wame.

THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE

IS

DISSOLVED.

October 9, Hol an and I sur Hol an and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of taffaffair so compleother consideration thother conat we both biat wnto a rointo a rointo a roar of lhtehter.

"I cannot see that theg very funny,g very funny," cried our client, flushing up to the rooof of his flaming head. "If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."

"No, n cr cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't m yo your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my sag sg so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the carponpon the door?"

"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the officesut none out none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an auntuntant living on thend flnd flooasked himasked him if he could tell me what had become of the Redadeaid that he had naid that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Rowaswas. He answered that the name was new t I, 'the gentleman at  I, 'the No. 4.'

" ' No. red-head red-head red-headed man?'

" 'Yes.'

" 'Oh,' said he, 'hilliam Morrisilliam Morris. He was a solicitandand was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out terterday.'

" 'Where could I find him?'

" 'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes7 K7 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'

"I started off, hen I got to thathen I got to that addreit it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. WilliMorMorris or Mr. Duncan Ross."

"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.

"I went home to Saxe-CobuSquSquare, and I tookce of my ce of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could onlyy ty that if I waited I should hear by post. But wast was ngood enougood enough, Mr. Holmes. I did nwiswish to lose such a placgle, so, as I hadgle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to givdvidvice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to ry wisely,"id id Holmery wiselys. "Your casxs. "ceedinglxceedinglxceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy it. Frohathatit. Frohathat you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at fi si sight appear."

"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four pound a week."

"Aar ar as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do not see that you have any grievance anstnst this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some $30, to  no nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the let A. A. You have lost nothing by them."

"Small,y quick in his way quick in his ways, noir ir on his face, though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead."

mesmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought as much," said he. "Have you ever erverved that his ears are pierced for earrings?"

"Yes, sir. He tolda gipsy ha gipsy had done it foim im when he was a lad."

"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still with Oh,OhOh,Oh,  I have o I have only just left him."

"And has your business been ar absenc

"Notr absenc

"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a morning."

"That will do, Mr. sonson. I shallan opinion upon the suan opiniobject in thefbjec a day of a day of a day or two. To-dis is Saturday, and I hope t we may come  we may come to a conclusion."

"Well, Watson," said Holmesen en our visitor had left us, "what do you make of it all?"

"I make nothing of it," I answered fray. y. "It is a most mysterious business."

"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is thessess mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzl, j, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this mar."r."

"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.

"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a toproblem,oproblem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled himself up in his cha wi with his thin kdrawndrawn uhawk-likehawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and he thrusting out le thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion thae he had dropped asleep, and indeed washe suddenly sprang outhe sudden of his chaie of  gesturee gesturee gesture of a man who has made up his mind and down upon thedown upon the mantelpiece.

"Sarasaplaplays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could youatiatients spare you for a few hours?"

"I have nothing to dtice is never vertice is never very absong.ng."

"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunon on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is ratherre re to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!We We travelled berground erground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Squ, t, the scene of the singular story which d lisd liste the morn the morning. It was a poky, little,abbabby-genteel place, of dingy two-storof dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small rad-id-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumpss made a hard ft at ags made a ainst a smoknainsd uncongnd uncongnd uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and  with "JABEIL with "JABEILSILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client card od on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked itl ol over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the streetnd nd then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the nbrnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, hent nt up to the door and knocked. It was  opened b opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young few, w, who asked him to step in.

"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only d to d to as you woul you would gromrom here to the Strand."

"Third right, fourd the assistant pd the assistant promptly, closing thooroor.

"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is, in my judgmen man in London, and fo man in Lr daring I aer da that hee that hee that he has not a claim to be third. I have kn of him befor of him before."

"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal ihishis mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you  merely in order  merely in order that ymigmight see him."

"Not him."

"What then?"

"The knees of his trousers."

"And what did you see?"
hathat I expected to see."

"Why did you beat the pavement?"

"My dear doctor, this is a time for obvatvation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Squareet et us now explore the parts which lie behind it."

The road in found ou found ourselves as we tur ro round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to ithe nthe nt icture doicture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries whtraffic of tCitCitraffic of tCitCity to the north and west.

It was difficult  we looked at we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premi th that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just ttetted.

"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, "I should l ju just to remember the order of the houses here.

My friend wan en enthusiastic musician, being h capable performer but capable  a composer r a cy ry merry ry merry ry merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stan the most pen the most perfect happiness, gently wag hg his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his ce and his languice and his languid, dre ey eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-dedded criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature altateately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thou, t, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him.  sw swing of e took hie took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he wnevnever so truly formidable as when, fys onys on ed been lod been lounging in his armchair amid hisproprovisations and editions.

When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's l Il I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.

"Yount nt to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we emerged.

"Yes, it would be as well."

"And Ive ve some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious."

" se serious?"

"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shabe be in time to stop it. But to-day urday raturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your heto-to-night."

"At what time?"

"Ten will be early enough."

"Il be l be atreet at treet at ten."

"y wy well. And, I say, Doctor, there may beer, so kindly puter, so kindly put your army revolver in r pr pocket." He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant ust that I am not moreust that  dense than o denurs, butours, butours, but I was always oppressed with a sense ofdity in my dedity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I haad heard, I had sad heard, I had seen whhe he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happenedt wt what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As Ioveove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the redadeaded copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words w wh which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expend why shnd why should I go armed? Wherereere we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faawnbrawnbrokstant wasstant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep gamzle it out, but ezle it out, but e ie it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.

It was a quer-er-pd from home and made md from hoy way across,y wa and so , and so , and so through Oxford Streto to Baker Street. ere standing ere standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the nd nd of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two m on one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, n, n, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.

"Ha! Our party comcomplete," said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the ra "W "Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mrather,o iather,o io is to be our companion in to-night's adventure."

"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you ," ," said  in h in hisntial wayntial way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man for startingwants is an old dwants is an old dog to help him to do the running down."

"I hope a wild goose may not prove be be the end of our chase," oer gloomily.

"Oh, if  sa say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the stranger with deference. "Still, I confess that I s ms my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rub."
